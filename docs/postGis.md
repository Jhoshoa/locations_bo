# PostGis
The geometry column type is primarily found in spatial databases, which are designed to store and manipulate geographic data. Specifically, this type is implemented in databases like PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension and MySQL.

## Types of Databases with Geometry Columns

### PostgreSQL with PostGIS:
        PostGIS extends PostgreSQL to support geographic objects, allowing for spatial queries and operations. The geometry type can represent various geometric shapes, including points, lines, and polygons, and is compliant with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards.
        Common geometric types include:
            POINT
            LINESTRING
            POLYGON
            MULTIPOINT
            MULTILINESTRING
            MULTIPOLYGON
            GEOMETRYCOLLECTION

        .

### MySQL:

    MySQL also supports spatial data types, including GEOMETRY, which can store various geometric shapes. It allows for both single-geometry and multi-geometry types, similar to PostGIS.
    Supported types include:
        POINT
        LINESTRING
        POLYGON
        MULTIPOINT
        MULTILINESTRING
        MULTIPOLYGON

            .

Data Used in Geometry Columns
Geometry columns are used to store spatial data that represents real-world objects and areas. This data is essential for applications that require geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis. Typical use cases include:

    Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Storing and analyzing geographic data for mapping applications.
    Urban Planning: Managing land use, zoning, and infrastructure planning.
    Environmental Studies: Analyzing geographical features and environmental data.
    Transportation: Managing routes, traffic data, and logistics.
    Real Estate: Analyzing property locations and boundaries.

## Conclusion
The geometry column type is integral to spatial databases like PostgreSQL with PostGIS and MySQL, enabling the storage and manipulation of complex spatial data. This functionality is crucial for a wide range of applications that rely on geographic information
